# deribitTrader

This project is a simple user interface that allows easy setup for monitoring
an algorithm that is traded on the [Deribit Exchange](https://www.deribit.com/).

A simple moving average crossover algorithm is provided, as it it up to the user
to research their own alpha, and write the code for it.

This project merely provides a skeleton for such algorithms.
